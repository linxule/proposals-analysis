# Decentralized funding? An analysis of three programs

Data that goes with [this post](https://nadiaeghbal.com/grant-programs), an analysis of community grant programs for three open source projects (Zcash, Monero, Dash).

Each folder has a .csv file and readme with notes on methodology and a key.

I coded proposal *type* and *type2* into the following categories. They're not perfect, but they are mine:

* *application*: Any downstream project
* *community*: Any activity intended to strengthen existing users of the project
* *conference*: Conference travel (not sponsoring a conference, that goes into *marketing*)
* *core*: Upstream work required to keep the project running (i.e. maintenance work)
* *design*: Any design work (UX, UI improvements, graphic design, etc)
* *documentation*: Improving project documentation
* *feature*: Building a new feature for the core project
* *governance*: Proposals about project governance, determined by voting (Dash only)
* *marketing*: Any activity intended to bring new users into the project or build awareness
* *research*: Research intended to answer questions related to the project
* *security*: Any activity explicitly focused on improving security of the code
* *translation*: Translation into a foreign language
